# This code has 5 syntax errors! Find them and correct them.
# When you have found and corrected all five, run the program
# and verify that it works. You can change the initial score
# to test different outcomes of the program.

# Create a variable called score, setting it to 10
score = 10

# If the score is zero or less
if scor <= 0:
  # Output to the user that they lose
  print("You Lose!)
else
  # Output - You Win! - and the score to the user
  print("You Win!")
  prnit("Your score is: ")
  print(score)

  # Wish the user good luck next time (If they win AND if they lose)
  print("Good luck next time.")
